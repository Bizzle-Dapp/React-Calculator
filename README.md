# Calculator

## OMGTechy's Project Specification:
### Make a calculator that can add, subtract, multiply and divide 2 numbers. The interface can be whatever you want: console, WPF GUI, REST API with a C++ frontend if you want. What matters is that the user can input 2 numbers and an operation. The numbers allowed can be limited to < 1000 if that helps you.
